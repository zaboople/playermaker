- Player
    Label keys C1 - G8 or whatever

- High playermaker
    - Load instruments into :
        # Example of using an instrument from sound bank 1152 - splitting it into two 7-bit parts
        n the MIDI protocol itself, bank numbers are split into two 7-bit parts and transmitted as the value
        of two controllers, "Bank Select" and "Bank Select LSB":
        ... = new ShortMessage(ShortMessage.CONTROL_CHANGE, 0, 0,  1152 >> 7);   // = 9
        ... = new ShortMessage(ShortMessage.CONTROL_CHANGE, 0, 32, 1152 & 0x7f); // = 0
        ... = new ShortMessage(ShortMessage.PROGRAM_CHANGE, 0, 14, 0);
    - Capture reverb messages from MidiDemo and figure out how they are sent.
        Okay they are never sent.
        Make it where we can send these straight to channel
            -pressure
            -reverb
    - Add C1, C2, C3, D1, D2, D3 to constants; easier than -12 +12 I think.
    - ARGH midi channel 10 is drums!!!!
        This article contains infor about what notes are what - map to constants:

        hey there's stuff in here about reverb and so forth so maybe...

    - Tests
        - Do a test where you tail off - a 1, 2., 2, 4, 8, 16
        - Test Chord.bpm()
            - Change speed - and put speed in player. My idea is that speed is typically 0, but
                you can enhance it by speed(+/-X). This means anytime a Sound is added, the
                speed needs to be added to it.
    - Hammer-ons/pull-offs
        - This makes no sense at all.
        - And a 16th that appears at the end of a half (right before another note)
        - Or a 16th that starts a half
    - Slurs/Slides or do we even - just do 128ths... but we could do them different
        - How about series of 128ths or whatever, and then a sort of finish...didn't i already make a finish?
    - Can't help but think you should just allow player to do bends/vibratos etc. on the last note played, and just
        have c() return player itself. But consider p(8,C).rest(16).n(16, D)

- Medium
    -Portamento, Legato, Reverb?

    - off-tune mode
        - create a map of notes to pitch bends, so that we can retrieve at runtime; this would go in the player itself.

- Low
    - For testing it would be nice to add multi-sequence play, i.e. play multiple MyMidi's in a row
    Speed should be modulated as well - don't apply it directly to the note speed, but after the note is transposed.

    -Bends need to throw exceptions when out of range
